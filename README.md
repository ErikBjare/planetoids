## Overview

Mini Solar System Explorer is a web-based 3D game where players begin on a small home planetoid equipped with a basic jetpack. The goal is to explore a solar system of 5 unique planets, discover new environments, and upgrade your equipment to reach increasingly distant worlds.

## Features

- **Immersive 3D Solar System**: 5 unique planets with their own characteristics and features
- **Realistic Physics**: Gravity and orbital mechanics simulation
- **Exploration-based Gameplay**: Discover new planets to earn points
- **Upgrade System**: Improve your jetpack, thrusters, and other equipment
- **First-person Controls**: Familiar WASD movement with jetpack capabilities

## Technical Details

- Built with Three.js for 3D rendering
- Written in modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- Uses ES6 modules for clean code organization
- Foundation for WebSocket-based multiplayer
- Fully client-side with no backend dependencies

## Installation and Running

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser with WebGL support
- A local web server (see options below)

### Running the Game

The game must be served from a web server due to ES6 module security requirements. Options include:

#### Using Python:
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

#### Using Node.js:
```bash
# Install serve globally
npm install -g serve

# Run the server
serve
```

Then open your browser and navigate to the provided URL (usually http://localhost:8000 or http://localhost:3000).

## Game Controls

- **W, A, S, D**: Move forward, left, backward, right
- **Mouse**: Look around
- **Space**: Jump when on planet surface
- **Hold Space**: Activate jetpack/thrusters
- **E**: Interact with upgrade stations
- **Tab**: Toggle upgrade menu

## Gameplay

1. Start on your home planet with a house, trees, mountains, and a pond
2. Collect discovery points by exploring planets
3. Find upgrade stations to improve your equipment
4. Use upgrades to reach more distant planets
5. Manage your fuel and navigate using orbital mechanics
6. Complete the game by visiting all five planets

## Planet Types

1. **Home**: Green planet with a house, trees, mountain ridge, and pond
2. **Rocky**: Smaller planet with rock formations and a research station
3. **Icy**: Large blue planet with ice formations and a frozen lake
4. **Desert**: Sandy planet with dunes, cacti, and an oasis
5. **Mysterious**: Purple alien planet with strange structures and crystals

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: Main HTML file with UI elements
- **main.js**: Game logic, physics, and player controls
- **world.js**: Solar system generation and game objects
